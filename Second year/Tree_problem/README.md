# Tree_problem
Task from Vladimirov K.I in 2nd grade.

In this program I tryied to code ```avl-tree``` realisation.

In this branch I united declarated and defined ```struct Node``` and ```struct Tree_it``` in the common class ```Tree```.

After compilation with help my ```Makefile``` you will have two files:

#### 1. ```tree_time.out``` - executable file for checking time of working my_tree and std::set
#### 2. ```tree_correct.out``` - executable file for checking correctness of working my_tree and std::set
